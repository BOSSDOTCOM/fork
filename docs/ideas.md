# Ideas log

Candidate improvements, each with the evidence needed to adopt it.

## Fields

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **type** | **ELO**: a playing-strength change. It's measured by SPRT and sits behind a config flag until accepted. **TOOLING**: infrastructure measured by its own success metric. No flag needed. |
| **phase** | When the idea is scheduled. |
| **metric** | What decides success (SPRT result for ELO; the stated metric for TOOLING). |
| **status** | untested, in progress, accepted, rejected (with the evidence). |
| **sources** | References consulted. Every outside source is also logged in docs/ORIGINALITY.md. Ideas only, never code. |

There were no entries before 2026-10-23, so no existing entries needed
marking as ELO. New ELO ideas use the same fields, with type ELO and the
name of their config flag.

## 1. Formal verification with Z3

- **type:** TOOLING
- **idea:** Prove that bit tricks, attack lookups, and later the SIMD
  kernels match their scalar references for *all* inputs, not just the
  tested ones.
- **phase:** Phase 1 Part C for movegen and attack code; Phase 4 for every
  NNUE SIMD kernel.
- **metric:** the proofs pass and stay in the test suite.
- **status:** untested

## 2. Automated kernel search

- **type:** TOOLING
- **idea:** Generate and benchmark many variants of hot functions, and keep
  the fastest.
- **phase:** Phase 1 Part C (attack lookups, table layouts, move lists);
  Phase 4 (NNUE layers, accumulator updates).
- **metric:** a measured speed gain with the bench node count unchanged
  (bench/ab.py and bench/experiment.sh are the starting point).
- **status:** untested

## 3. Cross-engine idea mining

- **type:** TOOLING
- **idea:** Review open-source engines' commit histories and tested changes,
  plus Go and shogi engine research, for ideas already shown to gain Elo.
  Ideas only, never code. Each source is logged in docs/ORIGINALITY.md.
- **phase:** before the Phase 3 search work, repeated before Phases 4-6.
- **metric / output:** a ranked list of candidate ELO ideas, entered in this
  log.
- **status:** untested

## 4. TCEC game mining for blind spots

- **type:** TOOLING (feeds ELO work)
- **idea:** Analyze TCEC game archives for positions where top engines'
  evaluations swung sharply, and mark systematic misjudgments.
- **phase:** Phase 4 (training data for NNUE) and Phase 7 (steering toward
  opponents' weak position types).
- **metric / output:** a blind-spot position set with categories.
- **note:** TCEC games carry the playing engines' evaluations. Any position
  set used as *training data* must be rescored by Fork itself, so that no
  other engine's labels enter training (docs/kb/originality.md).
- **status:** untested

## 5. Efficient testing

- **type:** TOOLING
- **idea:** Pentanomial SPRT statistics, adaptive test bounds, and ranking
  ideas by expected gain and test cost before spending games.
- **phase:** starts in Phase 3 when SPRT testing begins; formalized in
  Phase 8.
- **metric:** games needed per accepted change.
- **status:** untested

## 6. On-demand analysis tools

- **type:** TOOLING
- **idea:** Each tool is built when its phase needs it:
  - search tree visualizer (Phase 3)
  - evaluation breakdown viewer (Phase 4)
  - per-game time usage plots (Phase 5)
  - thread scaling charts (Phase 6)
- **metric:** not specified by the owner. Proposed: each tool diagnoses at
  least one real issue in its phase.
- **status:** untested
