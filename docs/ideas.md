# Ideas log

Candidate improvements, each with the evidence needed to adopt it.

## Fields

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **type** | **ELO**: a playing-strength change. It's measured by SPRT and sits behind a config flag until accepted. **TOOLING**: infrastructure measured by its own success metric. No flag needed. |
| **phase** | When the idea is scheduled. |
| **metric** | What decides success (SPRT result for ELO; the stated metric for TOOLING). |
| **status** | untested, in progress, accepted, rejected (with the evidence). |
| **sources** | References consulted. Every outside source is also logged in docs/ORIGINALITY.md. Ideas only, never code. |

There were no entries before 2026-10-23, so no existing entries needed
marking as ELO. New ELO ideas use the same fields, with type ELO and the
name of their config flag.

## 1. Formal verification with Z3

- **type:** TOOLING
- **idea:** Prove that bit tricks, attack lookups, and later the SIMD
  kernels match their scalar references for *all* inputs, not just the
  tested ones.
- **phase:** Phase 1 Part C for movegen and attack code; Phase 4 for every
  NNUE SIMD kernel.
- **metric:** the proofs pass and stay in the test suite.
- **status:** untested

## 2. Automated kernel search

- **type:** TOOLING
- **idea:** Generate and benchmark many variants of hot functions, and keep
  the fastest.
- **phase:** Phase 1 Part C (attack lookups, table layouts, move lists);
  Phase 4 (NNUE layers, accumulator updates).
- **metric:** a measured speed gain with the bench node count unchanged
  (bench/ab.py and bench/experiment.sh are the starting point).
- **status:** untested

## 3. Cross-engine idea mining

- **type:** TOOLING
- **idea:** Review open-source engines' commit histories and tested changes,
  plus Go and shogi engine research, for ideas already shown to gain Elo.
  Ideas only, never code. Each source is logged in docs/ORIGINALITY.md.
- **phase:** before the Phase 3 search work, repeated before Phases 4-6.
- **metric / output:** a ranked list of candidate ELO ideas, entered in this
  log.
- **status:** untested

## 4. TCEC game mining for blind spots

- **type:** TOOLING (feeds ELO work)
- **idea:** Analyze TCEC game archives for positions where top engines'
  evaluations swung sharply, and mark systematic misjudgments.
- **phase:** Phase 4 (training data for NNUE) and Phase 7 (steering toward
  opponents' weak position types).
- **metric / output:** a blind-spot position set with categories.
- **note:** TCEC games carry the playing engines' evaluations. Any position
  set used as *training data* must be rescored by Fork itself, so that no
  other engine's labels enter training (docs/kb/originality.md).
- **status:** untested

## 5. Efficient testing

- **type:** TOOLING
- **idea:** Pentanomial SPRT statistics, adaptive test bounds, and ranking
  ideas by expected gain and test cost before spending games.
- **phase:** starts in Phase 3 when SPRT testing begins; formalized in
  Phase 8.
- **metric:** games needed per accepted change.
- **status:** untested

## 6. On-demand analysis tools

- **type:** TOOLING
- **idea:** Each tool is built when its phase needs it:
  - search tree visualizer (Phase 3)
  - evaluation breakdown viewer (Phase 4)
  - per-game time usage plots (Phase 5)
  - thread scaling charts (Phase 6)
- **metric:** not specified by the owner. Proposed: each tool diagnoses at
  least one real issue in its phase.
- **status:** untested

## 7. TCEC-opening specialization

- **type:** ELO
- **flag:** none needed for the testing use. For training, the data mix is
  selected by the training-pipeline config (Phase 4), with a net trained with
  and without the TCEC-opening positions.
- **idea:** Collect the openings TCEC used in past seasons from its
  published archives, and use them in two ways:
  1. as the opening set for all long-time-control confirmation testing;
  2. as a source of starting positions for NNUE training data, so that Fork's
     evaluation is strongest in the unbalanced structures it will actually be
     assigned.
- **phase:** Phase 4 (training data) and Phase 8 (testing).
- **metric:** SPRT on held-out TCEC openings that weren't used in training.
- **note:**
  - TCEC books are built with engine evaluations. Only the *positions* may be
    used for training, as starting points that Fork's own self-play then
    plays out and scores. No book or archive evaluations may be used as
    labels (docs/kb/originality.md).
  - Record which seasons' openings went into training and which were held
    out.
- **status:** untested

## 8. Swiss-specific contempt

- **type:** ELO
- **flag:** a UCI style/contempt option (Phase 7), set per event and per
  opponent.
- **idea:** Win-seeking against lower-rated opponents; accepting draws
  against much stronger ones. It's driven by opponent rating when the
  tournament provides one (for example, the UCI `UCI_Opponent` option where
  the GUI sends it, or event configuration), and it's part of Fork's
  genuine evaluation and search preferences. It must never alter reported
  scores to trigger or avoid adjudication (the Phase 7 rule).
- **phase:** Phase 7.
- **metric:** SPRT in Swiss-like gauntlets: against weaker pinned opponents
  (score gain), and against stronger ones (no loss in score).
- **note:** whether TCEC's Swiss passes opponent identity or rating to
  engines is unverified. The current TCEC Swiss research (docs/kb, kb
  branch) should answer it.
- **status:** untested
